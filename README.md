# What is this?
JS Ports of "BASIC Computer Games" (Ahl 1978). Kids my age transcribed and hacked on this stuff back in the 70s + 80s.

See a demo at (http://stopsky.net/bcg-ports).

# Build
Use compass to recompile the sass & toss it all on a server.

# Credits
* Ahl + the original authors of the games
* Rad CRT effect by Lucas Bebber (http://codepen.io/lbebber/pen/XJRdrV/)
